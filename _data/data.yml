    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hi! I am Hughes, a computer vision enthusiast, specialized in object detection, instance segmentation and video object detection in urban environment. I am particularly interested in using computer vision for greater safety and automation in transportation. In recent years, I have worked primarily with deep learning, including tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Although, I must say that the mathematical elegance of classical computer vision still fascinates me. During my Ph.D., I produced results on multiple popular road user datasets including Cityscapes, KITTI, India Driving, UA-DETRAC and UAVDT. My accomplishments include receiving the Springer best paper award (1st place) for ICIAR 2020 for RN-VID, achieving the top result on the UA-DETRAC object detection benchmark with SpotNet and achieving the top result for real-time instance segmentation on Cityscapes, KITTI and IDD with CenterPoly. I am currently working as an AI scientist at Thales.
