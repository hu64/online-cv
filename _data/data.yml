    summary: |

      Hi! I am Hughes, a computer vision enthusiast specialized in object recognition and general scene understanding in urban environments. I am particularly interested in using computer vision for greater safety and automation in transportation applications. In recent years, I have worked primarily with deep learning, including tools like TensorFlow and PyTorch, even though I still have a strong interest in classical computer vision. During my Ph.D., I produced results on multiple popular road user datasets including Cityscapes, KITTI, India Driving, UA-DETRAC and UAVDT. Here is a brief summary of my academic accomplishments. First, I received the Springer best paper award (1st place) for ICIAR 2020 with RN-VID. Second, I reached the top result on the UA-DETRAC object detection benchmark with SpotNet. Third, I reached the top result for real-time instance segmentation on Cityscapes, KITTI and IDD with CenterPoly. I am currently working as an AI scientist at Thales where I worked on general optimization, multimodal image registration and fusion, and object detection and tracking among other things.

      Fun fact, my Dijkstra number is five <a href="https://www.csauthors.net/distance/edsger-w-dijkstra/hughes-perreault" target="_blank">(click here)</a> and my Erdos number is also five <a href="https://www.csauthors.net/distance/paul-erdos/hughes-perreault" target="_blank">(click here)</a>.
